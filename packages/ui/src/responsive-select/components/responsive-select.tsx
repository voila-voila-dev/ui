 * A composable select with two surfaces from one declaration: the Base UI
 * `Select` popup on desktop and the OS-native `<select>` under the
 * `useIsMobile` breakpoint (768px), where the native picker is the better
 * touch experience. The parts map 1:1 to the underlying `Select` parts on
 * desktop; a native `<select>` is monolithic, so on mobile the `Root` projects
 * the part elements onto a single `NativeSelect` (see
 * `responsive-select-children.ts` for the nesting that projection requires).
