 * Three surfaces, one `Date | null` value model, in the shape every picker
 * family here follows: `Root` is the composed popover, `Native` is the OS
 * control, and `Responsive` picks between them at the `useIsMobile` breakpoint.
 * `Range`, `NativeRange` and `ResponsiveRange` are the same three surfaces for
 * a `{ start, end }` range. `ShiftRange` collects a whole shift behind one
 * trigger, each end carrying its own date so an overnight shift needs no wrap
 * trick.
